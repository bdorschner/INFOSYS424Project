#Daily Scrum Meetings

We chose to document our ‘stand-up’ Scrum meetings from 3/2/23, 3/7/23, and 3/9/23. Our reports from those dates are as follows:

3/2/23

Al and Drew: For our responsibilities this sprint, we worked collaboratively. Today, we gathered information pertaining to the user stories. This information was aggregated from our planning we performed for milestone 1, which involved our problem analysis and scope definition. Yesterday, we planned our workflow for gathering these user stories, laying out a time to meet and work together on the project. Currently, we are not facing any major issues, but we are still discussing with the group how to handle merging branches properly.

Jacob: Yesterday, I created the index.html file and the app.js file. I put together a wireframe for the site, creating placeholder content for all of our planned pages, a responsive navbar menu with compatible javascript for mobile browsing, and variable/function definition in app.js to handle the ‘is-hidden’ tags on each of the page containers within the index.html page. Today, I plan to monitor the github and review my merge to make sure that everything goes as planned as the other group members begin their contributions. I have not faced any issues as of yet. 

Brian: Yesterday, I discussed project responsibilities with my other group members. Today, I began reviewing the Justinmind prototype to plan out how the ‘Resources’ page should be structured. I have not run into any problems yet. 

Michael: From my current work, I spoke with group members about dividing up the workload for this sprint. Yesterday, I came up with a general description of the project, based on the problem analysis and project scope assignment. Today, I don’t plan on completing any work until the wireframe of the site is completed. I have not encountered any problems today. 


3/7/23

Al and Drew: Yesterday, we added significant updates to the README, based on the project criteria provided in the rubric. We also created and pushed our first commit to the ‘About-Us/Contact-Us’ branch. Today, we don’t plan on completing any additional work due to schedule conflicts, but we are discussing some of the issues encountered during our preliminary development work. We’ve encountered some issues with responsive styling, which we plan to sort out as we move into Sprint 2. 

Jacob: Yesterday, I monitored the Trello board and reviewed any remaining tasks in the backlog. Today, I plan on dividing up the remainder of the work evenly among our group members. I have not encountered any issues today. 

Brian: Yesterday, I made and pushed my first commit to the ‘Resources’ branch. Today, I don’t plan on completing any additional work. No problems were encountered today. 

Michael: Yesterday, I completed the general layout structure of the home page. Today, I plan on merging the ‘main’ branch into my ‘homepage’ branch. I’ve encountered some minor problems with the layout of the social media icons, which I plan to resolve using the Bulma ‘tiles’ styling options, as we move into Sprint 2. 


3/9/23

Al, Drew, Jacob, Brian, and Michael: Yesterday, we fixed some minor formatting issues, confirmed that all merges were performed properly, and added the ‘ISS New Member Video’ iframe to the homepage. Today, we plan to compile and place most of our work into the README. Although we’ve faced some minor issues, including an unexplained problem with the placeholder content on the ‘Attendance History’ page, we plan to resolve these into Sprint 2, as the majority of us will be out of town for spring break by the end of the day. 


#Sprint Review: 

What did you learn from doing our first sprint? - 

We learned how to execute agile's planning, analysis, design, and implementation phase. From creating a wireframe using Justinmind to utilizing Bulma framworks for styling, we successfully completed the front-end focused sprint that we had planned. 

What did go well? Why? - 

Through daily scrum meetings, progress was steady, and updates were effectively communicated and handled. Completion of a functional site that matched the styling of our prototype was excellent, and helped us to meet client expectations. 

What didn’t go well? Why not? - 

Aside from some minor bugs and git issues that were quickly resolved, our sprint went according to plan. However, communication about allocation of responsibilities proved to be difficult, as communicating through asynchronous virtual mediums (IM, email, etc.) led to some confusion. We hope to resolve this during our next sprint by being more consistent with in-person meetings. 

How can you make things better next time? - 

We must continue to communicate effectively with each other as the project progresses in complexity. To make things better for our next sprint, we aim to meet more consistently in-person, particularly during the beginning of the sprint. This will allow us to complete the bulk of our responsibilities at the beginning of the sprint, giving us additional time at the end to focus on bug fixing and addressing any issues that may arise. 

Are you satisfied with what you already completed? - 

Yes. Our goal was to complete the static content by the end of the first sprint. We achieved this goal, as well as going beyond that goal to implement limited JavaScript. However, we hope to make further progress in sprint 2, creating a fully-functional prototype with dynamic content, and a Firebase backend. 

Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present? - 

We met with Group 8 for our sprint review. Group 8's sprint similarly performed as ours based on our meeting after class. We met in-person and discussed what went well from a technical and organizational perspective, and what could be improved in the next sprint, based on the successes and setbacks of each group. Everybody was present.
