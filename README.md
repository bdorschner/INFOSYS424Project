#User Stories
1. As a ISS member, I want to be able to access a dedicated club website with a home page, about us page, contact page, and resources page with displayed content, so I can have a point of contact and information during my membership.
2. As a ISS member, I want to be able to reap the benefits of a simplistic and organized design, so I can have smooth browsing process and user experience.
