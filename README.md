Sprint Review: 

What did you learn from doing our first sprint? - 

We learned how to execute agile's planning, analysis, design, and implementation phase. From creating a wireframe using Justinmind to utilizing Bulma framworks for styling, we successfully completed the front-end focused sprint that we had planned. 

What did go well? Why? - 

Through daily scrum meetings, progress was steady, and updates were effectively communicated and handled. 

What didn’t go well? Why not? - 

Aside from some minor bugs and git issues that were quickly resolved, our sprint went according to plan. 

How can you make things better next time? - 

We must continue to communicate effectively with each other as the project progresses in complexity. 

Are you satisfied with what you already completed? - 

Yes. 

Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present? - 

Group 8's sprint similarly performed as ours based on our meeting after class. Everybody was present.
